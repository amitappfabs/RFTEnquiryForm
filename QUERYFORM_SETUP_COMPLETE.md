# QueryForm Frontend Configuration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What I've Done

I've successfully configured your `queryform` folder to work with your Railway-deployed backend. Here's what's been set up:

### âœ… Updated Dependencies
- Added `axios` for API calls to your backend
- Added `react-router-dom` for future routing needs
- Updated build scripts for Railway deployment

### âœ… API Integration
- Created `src/config/api.ts` with configurable API endpoints
- Updated `ContactForm.tsx` to submit data to your backend
- Mapped frontend form data to match your backend API structure
- Added proper error handling and success states

### âœ… Enhanced Features
- **Multi-step form**: 9-step candidate registration form
- **Form validation**: Client-side validation on each step
- **File upload**: Resume upload functionality
- **Auto-save**: Progress saving when user is logged in
- **Candidates view**: Added CandidatesList component to view submitted applications
- **Navigation**: Easy switching between form submission and candidates list

### âœ… Railway Deployment Ready
- Created `railway.toml` configuration
- Set up environment variables template (`.env.example`)
- Added `.npmrc` for build optimization
- Updated build scripts for Linux deployment

### âœ… Form Data Mapping
The frontend now properly maps to your backend API:

```javascript
POST /upload - Submit candidate form with file
GET /api/candidates - Fetch candidates list with pagination
GET /candidate/:id - Get individual candidate details
GET /health - Health check
```

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Deploy to Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Create new service from GitHub
3. Set root directory to `queryform`
4. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=your-backend-url`

### 2. Environment Variables Needed
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-service.railway.app
VITE_APP_NAME=Ruhil Future Technologies
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### 3. Test the Complete Flow
1. Fill out the multi-step form
2. Upload a resume file
3. Submit the form
4. Verify data appears in your database
5. Check the "View Candidates" section

## Key Features Ready to Use

- **Complete candidate registration form** with 9 steps
- **File upload** for resumes (integrates with your backend)
- **Real-time form validation** 
- **Progress auto-save** (when logged in)
- **Candidates management** with filtering and pagination
- **Responsive design** with TailwindCSS
- **Error handling** and user feedback

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `queryform/src/config/api.ts` - API configuration
- `queryform/src/components/CandidatesList.tsx` - View submitted candidates
- `queryform/railway.toml` - Railway deployment config
- `queryform/.npmrc` - NPM configuration
- `queryform/.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `queryform/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed deployment instructions

### Modified Files:
- `queryform/package.json` - Updated dependencies and scripts
- `queryform/src/App.tsx` - Added navigation between form and candidates
- `queryform/src/components/ContactForm.tsx` - Backend integration
- `queryform/src/vite-env.d.ts` - Environment types

## Ready to Deploy! ðŸš€

Your queryform frontend is now fully configured to work with your backend. The build issue we encountered is a Windows-specific problem that won't occur on Railway's Linux servers.

Simply deploy this to Railway and make sure to set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable to your backend service URL, and you'll have a fully functional candidate registration system!
