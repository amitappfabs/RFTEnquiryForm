# Frontend Startup Issue Fixed! ðŸ”§

## Problem Identified
The frontend was building successfully but failing to start properly. The issue was:

**Root Cause**: Vite's preview server was binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) instead of `0.0.0.0`, making it inaccessible from outside the container.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. âœ… Added Static Server (Primary Fix)
- Added `serve` package as a dependency
- Created `npm start` script: `serve -s dist -l $PORT`
- Updated Railway config to use `npm start` instead of `npm run preview`

### 2. âœ… Fixed Vite Preview (Backup Option)
- Updated Vite preview to bind to `0.0.0.0`
- Added proper host configuration in `vite.config.ts`
- Added `@types/node` for TypeScript support

### 3. âœ… Updated Configuration Files
- **package.json**: Added serve dependency and start script
- **railway.toml**: Changed startCommand to `npm start`
- **nixpacks.toml**: Updated start command
- **vite.config.ts**: Added proper host binding

## Why This Fixes The Issue

### Before (Not Working):
```bash
vite preview  # Binds to localhost:4173 (not accessible externally)
```

### After (Working):
```bash
serve -s dist -l $PORT  # Serves static files on all interfaces
```

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Added serve dependency and start script
- `railway.toml` - Changed to npm start
- `nixpacks.toml` - Updated start command  
- `vite.config.ts` - Added host configuration

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push these changes** to your repository
2. **Railway will automatically redeploy**
3. **The application should now be accessible** at your Railway URL

## Expected Result
âœ… Frontend builds successfully  
âœ… Static server starts properly  
âœ… Application accessible on Railway URL  
âœ… API calls work to your backend  
âœ… Complete candidate registration flow functional  

## Testing Checklist
After deployment:
1. Open your Railway frontend URL
2. Verify the page loads correctly
3. Test form submission
4. Check "View Candidates" functionality
5. Ensure file uploads work

The "Application failed to respond" error should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
