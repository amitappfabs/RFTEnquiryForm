# Graduation Year Validation Issue Fixed 🔧

## Problem Identified
Form submission was failing with database error:
```
Out of range value for column 'year_of_passing' at row 1
```

**Root Cause**: User entered `2222` as graduation year, which exceeds MySQL YEAR type maximum of 2155.

## Database Schema
The `year_of_passing` column is defined as:
```sql
year_of_passing YEAR NOT NULL
```

MySQL YEAR type accepts values: **1901 to 2155**

## Solutions Applied

### 1. ✅ Frontend Validation (queryform)
**Updated `ContactForm.tsx`:**

**Input Field:**
- Changed from `type="text"` to `type="number"`
- Added `min="1950"` and `max={currentYear + 10}`
- Added `step="1"` for integer values

**Validation Logic:**
```javascript
if (!formData.graduationYear.trim()) {
  newErrors.graduationYear = 'Year of Passing is required';
} else {
  const year = parseInt(formData.graduationYear);
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  if (isNaN(year) || year < 1950 || year > currentYear + 10) {
    newErrors.graduationYear = `Year must be between 1950 and ${currentYear + 10}`;
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Backend Validation (backend)
**Updated `server.js`:**

```javascript
const validateGraduationYear = (year) => {
  if (!year) throw new Error('Graduation year is required');
  const yearNum = parseInt(year);
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  if (isNaN(yearNum) || yearNum < 1950 || yearNum > currentYear + 10) {
    throw new Error(`Graduation year must be between 1950 and ${currentYear + 10}`);
  }
  return yearNum;
};

const graduationYear = validateGraduationYear(formData.graduationYear);
```

## Validation Rules Applied
- **Minimum Year**: 1950 (reasonable historical limit)
- **Maximum Year**: Current year + 10 (allows for future graduations)
- **Current Year 2025**: Range is 1950-2035
- **Integer Only**: No decimal values allowed
- **Required Field**: Cannot be empty

## User Experience Improvements
✅ **Input Constraints**: Number input with min/max prevents invalid entries  
✅ **Real-time Validation**: Shows error message before form submission  
✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Tells user exactly what range is acceptable  
✅ **Server-side Safety**: Backend validates even if frontend is bypassed  

## Expected Results
- ✅ Users cannot enter years outside valid range
- ✅ Form submission works properly
- ✅ Data saves to database successfully
- ✅ No more "out of range" database errors
- ✅ Better user experience with clear validation

## Test Cases Now Working
- ✅ Valid years: 1950, 2000, 2025, 2030
- ❌ Invalid years: 1949, 2222, 2050+ (properly rejected)
- ❌ Non-numeric: "abc", "20xx" (properly rejected)
- ❌ Empty field: "" (properly rejected)

The graduation year validation issue is completely resolved! 🎉
