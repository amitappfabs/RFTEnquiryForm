# Railway Deployment Fix Applied ðŸ”§

## Problem
The build was failing due to missing Rollup optional dependencies:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. âœ… Fixed Package.json
- Removed complex build script that was reinstalling packages
- Downgraded Vite from `^5.4.19` to `^5.0.0` for better stability
- Removed platform-specific optional dependencies
- Simplified build process to just `vite build`

### 2. âœ… Updated Configuration Files
- **nixpacks.toml**: Added proper build phases
- **.npmrc**: Enabled optional dependencies (`optional=true`)
- **.nvmrc**: Set Node.js version to 18
- **railway.toml**: Set `NPM_CONFIG_OPTIONAL=true`

### 3. âœ… Build Process Now
```bash
npm ci                # Install with optional dependencies
npm run build         # Simple vite build
npm run preview       # Start the server
```

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Simplified scripts and downgraded Vite
- `nixpacks.toml` - Added proper build configuration
- `.npmrc` - Enabled optional dependencies
- `railway.toml` - Added NPM_CONFIG_OPTIONAL=true
- `.nvmrc` - Set Node.js version

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Redeploy Current Service
1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. The build should now succeed

### Option 2: Fresh Deployment
1. Create new Railway service
2. Connect to your repository
3. Set root directory to `queryform`
4. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=your-backend-url`
5. Deploy

## Environment Variables Required
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-service.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
NPM_CONFIG_OPTIONAL=true
```

## Expected Build Success
The build should now complete successfully with:
- âœ… Dependencies installed correctly
- âœ… Vite build completes without Rollup errors
- âœ… Preview server starts
- âœ… Frontend connects to your backend

## Test After Deployment
1. Open the deployed frontend URL
2. Fill out the candidate registration form
3. Upload a resume file
4. Submit the form
5. Check that data appears in your backend database
6. Use "View Candidates" to see submitted applications

The build errors should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
